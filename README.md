## Work Allocation
### Functional Requirements
Login and administrative use case - Maria
	*this includes testing for:
		(1) Service contract
		(2) functional requirements (to be able to login?)
		(3) the process

### Non-Functional Requirements
Login and administrative use case - Maria
	*testing non functional requirements for:
		(1) Performance
		(2) usability
		(3) reliability
		
Question: Can non functioanl requirements tested on each use-case,shouldn't they be tested on the system as a whole? *confused><.
